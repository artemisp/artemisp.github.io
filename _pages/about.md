I am a fourth year PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania working in the intersection of Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision under the supervision of Professor Chris Callison-Burch and Professor Mark Yatskar. 

My research focuses on advancing multimodal AI by integrating diverse modalities such as images, audio, video, text, and 3D. I address challenges in multimodal integration, benchmark development, and enhancing interpretability to build trustworthy models. My mission is to craft models that can see, listen, and comprehend with the nuance of perceptual coherenceâ€”models that are as robust as they are insightful, and as interpretable as they are performant, bringing us closer to a future where machines are not just tools, but reliable, insightful collaborators.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I have a strong passion for education. As a Teaching Assistant at the University of Pennsylvania, and through my community teaching experiences, I strive to challenge students with the beautiful and mentally stimulating concepts of mathematics, logic, and computer science, while also breaking down any mental barriers that may have been created from past negative experiences.

<b>I am convinced that computer science is a field accessible to all, no matter their background, identity, or prior experience. In our technology-driven society, enabling people from various backgrounds and experiences to contribute to and shape the future of computer science is essential for creating strong and inclusive technological solutions.</b>
