ðŸ“¢ **Announcement: We released [X-InstructBLIP](https://artemisp.github.io/X-InstructBLIP-page/) a simple and effective, scalable cross-modal framework to empower LLMs to handle a diverse range of tasks across a variety of modalities (image, text, video, audio, and 3D), without requiring modality-specific pre-training.
